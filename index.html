                <h3>Welcome to Brisbane's Online Sustainability Hub</h3>
                <p>
                    As the impacts of climate change become increasingly felt; from extreme weather
                    to rising temperatures, and changing ecosystems, <b>it's becoming more and more important
                    for our community to stay informed and take action together </b>. This resource has been
                    created so that Brisbanites can stay up to date with climate facts, localised statistics
                    and practical steps that individuals and families can take to live more sustainably.
                    <br><br>
                    Explore detailed insights into Brisbane's environmental challenges, discover inspiring
                    community-led projects, and find resources, all tailored to help you <b>make a difference </b>.
                    <br><br>
                    Together, we can work to protect our natural environmental, strengthen our community's
                    response and resilience, and build a <b>healthier, cleaner future for generations to come</b>.
